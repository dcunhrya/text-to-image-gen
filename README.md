# Text-to-Image Generator

We present models to perform text to image generation and image reconstruction using a conditional VAE (CVAE) trained on Fashion-MNIST for short-text
and COCO for long-text with a CLIP feature extractor. In total, three main experiments were run. The first experiment involved short-text model architecture investigation between fully connected and a convolutional CVAE, where the convolutional CVAE was found to have a lower MSE and higher SSIM and FID. The second experiment tested long-text image generation and reconstruction on images of size 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256. The third experiment tested concatenating versus adding the conditional input in the CVAE from the COCO annotation using the features extracted by CLIP. Both conditioning methods resulted in similar results for sizes of 64x64 and 128x128, but the concatenation conditioning significantly outperformed the adding conditioning with 256x256 images.
